recipeNotes:
  [
    "New potatoes work best for this recipe due to their thin skins and creamy texture. You can use baby red or baby Yukon gold potatoes.",
    "Feel free to use salted butter if you prefer, adjusting the added salt accordingly. You can also use olive oil for a different flavor profile.",
    "Using fresh dill enhances the flavor of the dish. If unavailable, you can use dried dill, but reduce the quantity as dried herbs are more concentrated.",
    "Add minced garlic or a squeeze of lemon juice for additional flavor variations.",
    "Leftovers can be refrigerated and reheated, but the texture may change slightly. Enjoy them fresh for the best taste and texture.",
