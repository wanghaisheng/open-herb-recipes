recipeNotes:
  [
    "There are two common methods for making chicken broth: discarding the first boil or skimming the scum. Discarding the first boil can result in a clearer broth, while skimming the scum is a faster method. Whichever method you choose, be sure to simmer the broth for at least 20 minutes to extract flavor from the chicken and vegetables.",
    "For a richer flavored broth, roast the chicken breast or thighs in the oven at 400°F (200°C) for 20 minutes before adding it to the pot.",
    "Feel free to customize the vegetables in your soup. Add other chopped vegetables like zucchini, peas, or green beans.",
