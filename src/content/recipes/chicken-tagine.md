recipeNotes:
  [
    "Marinating Time: For deeper flavors, marinate the chicken overnight in the refrigerator with the spices, garlic, and a bit of olive oil.",
    "If you have a traditional tagine pot, use it to cook the dish. Otherwise, a heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven will work just fine.",
    "This dish is traditionally served with couscous, but it can also be enjoyed with bread or rice.",
    "Preserved Lemons: If you can’t find preserved lemons, use fresh lemon zest and a little extra salt as a substitute.",
    "Be careful with salt as olives and preserved lemons are already salty.",
    "Chicken tagine can be made ahead of time; in fact, it tastes even better the next day as the flavors meld.",
