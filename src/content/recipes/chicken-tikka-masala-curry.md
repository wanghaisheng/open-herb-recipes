steps:
  - title: "Marinate the Chicken"
    actions:
      - "In a bowl, combine cubed chicken breast with yogurt, lemon juice, ginger-garlic paste, turmeric, garam masala, paprika, salt, and pepper. Mix well to coat the chicken evenly. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, or ideally overnight for maximum flavor."
  - title: "Prepare the Sauce"
    actions:
      - "In a large skillet or pan, heat oil over medium heat."
      - "Add chopped onions, garlic, and ginger. Saut√© until onions are soft and translucent."
      - "Stir in chopped bell peppers, diced tomatoes, tomato paste, and a blend of ground cumin, coriander, and chili powder. Cook for another 5-7 minutes, until the peppers are tender."
      - "Pour in coconut milk and stir to combine. Let the sauce simmer gently for 10-15 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together."
  - title: "Cook the Chicken"
    actions:
      - "While the sauce simmers, preheat the grill or oven broiler to high heat."
