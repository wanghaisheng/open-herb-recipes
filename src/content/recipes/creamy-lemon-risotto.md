recipeNotes:
  [
    "Barley: You can substitute the barley with another grain such as farro or quinoa if you prefer.",
    "Risotto: Remember to stir the risotto often while adding the broth. This releases the rice's starches and gives the risotto its characteristic creaminess.",
    "Parmesan Cheese: Use a high-quality Parmesan for the best flavor. You can also substitute with another similar cheese such as pecorino or Grana Padano.",
    "Store leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days. Reheat before serving.",
