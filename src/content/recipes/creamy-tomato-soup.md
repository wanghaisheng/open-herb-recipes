recipeNotes:
  [
    "Tomato Choice: For the richest flavor, use ripe, in-season tomatoes. If out of season, canned San Marzano tomatoes are a good substitute.",
    "Cream Alternatives: For a vegan version, use coconut milk or cashew cream instead of dairy cream.",
    "For a smoother soup, blend thoroughly. For a chunkier texture, blend only half or use a potato masher.",
    "Garnish with fresh basil or croutons for extra flavor and crunch.",
    "Storing: This soup can be stored in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days, or freeze for longer storage.",
    "The soup's consistency can be adjusted according to your preference by adding more broth or cream.",
    "This creamy tomato soup pairs wonderfully with a grilled cheese sandwich or a side salad for a complete meal.",
    "For an extra touch of richness, a dollop of crème fraîche or a sprinkle of grated Parmesan cheese can also be added upon serving.",
