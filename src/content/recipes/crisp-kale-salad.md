recipeNotes:
  [
    "Kale: Massaging the kale with the dressing helps to break down the toughness of the leaves and makes them more enjoyable to eat.",
    "Toppings: Feel free to customize your salad with your favorite toppings. Some good options include toasted nuts, seeds, dried cranberries, or crumbled cheese.",
    "This salad keeps well in the fridge for a day or two, even with the dressing on. The sturdy kale leaves don't wilt as quickly as other salad greens.",
