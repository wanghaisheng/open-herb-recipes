steps:
  - title: "Prepare the Grape Leaves"
    actions:
      - "If using jarred grape leaves, rinse them under cold water to remove excess brine. If using fresh grape leaves, blanch them in boiling water for 2-3 minutes, then transfer to an ice bath to cool."
      - "Carefully remove the stems from the grape leaves and set them aside."
  - title: "Prepare the Filling"
    actions:
      - "In a mixing bowl, combine ground meat (such as lamb or beef), cooked rice, finely chopped onion, minced garlic, chopped parsley, dried mint, ground cinnamon, ground allspice, salt, and pepper."
      - "Mix the filling ingredients until well combined."
  - title: "Assemble the Dolma"
    actions:
      - "Place a grape leaf on a flat surface with the shiny side down and the stem end facing you."
      - "Take a tablespoon of the filling mixture and place it near the stem end of the grape leaf."
      - "Fold the bottom of the leaf over the filling, then fold in the sides, and roll tightly to form a neat cylinder."
      - "Repeat with the remaining grape leaves and filling mixture."
  - title: "Cook the Dolma"
    actions:
      - "Line the bottom of a large pot with any torn or unused grape leaves to prevent sticking."
      - "Arrange the stuffed grape leaves in the pot in tight layers, seam side down."
      - "Pour in enough water or broth to cover the dolma completely."
      - "Place a heatproof plate upside down on top of the dolma to keep them submerged while cooking."
      - "Cover the pot with a lid and bring the liquid to a boil."
      - "Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 60-70 minutes, or until the grape leaves are tender and the filling is cooked through."
  - title: "Voila!"
    actions:
      - "Once cooked, remove the dolma from the pot using a slotted spoon and transfer them to a serving platter."
      - "Serve hot or at room temperature, garnished with a squeeze of lemon juice and a dollop of yogurt or tzatziki sauce if desired."

recipeNotes:
  [
    "Grape Leaves: If using jarred grape leaves, rinse them well to remove excess brine. If using fresh grape leaves, blanch them briefly in boiling water to soften before using.",
    "Ground lamb or beef is traditional for dolma, but you can use a combination of both for added flavor.",
    "Use cooked rice in the filling mixture. You can use long-grain white rice or short-grain rice, such as Arborio.",
    "Cooking Liquid: Water or broth can be used to cook the dolma. The liquid should cover the dolma completely in the pot.",
    "Leftover dolma can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 3 days. Reheat gently before serving.",
    "Variations: Dolma can be made vegetarian by omitting the meat and doubling the amount of rice. You can also add pine nuts or currants to the filling for extra texture and flavor.",
