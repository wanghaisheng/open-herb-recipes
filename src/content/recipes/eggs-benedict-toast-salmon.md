recipeNotes:
  [
    "Use fresh eggs for poaching, as they hold their shape better in the water.",
    "Hollandaise Tips: Ensure the water in the double boiler is barely simmering to prevent the eggs from scrambling. If the sauce gets too thick, you can thin it out with a little warm water.",
    "Salmon Substitution: If preferred, you can use cooked bacon, ham, or spinach as a substitute for the smoked salmon.",
    "English Muffin Variation: Feel free to use other types of bread such as brioche or sourdough for a different flavor profile.",
    "The hollandaise sauce can be made ahead of time and gently reheated before serving. Poach the eggs just before assembling.",
    "Add sliced avocado or tomato for extra flavor and texture, or sprinkle with capers for a briny kick.",
