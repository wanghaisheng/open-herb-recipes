    "Marination: The longer you marinate the chicken, the more flavorful it will be. If you have the time, it's recommended to marinate the chicken overnight.",
    "Green Beans: For a more vibrant color, you can quickly put the blanched green beans into an ice bath after boiling. This will also help them retain a nice crunch.",
    "This dish works perfectly with a side of Greek salad or a slice of fresh bread.",
