recipeNotes:
  [
    "For best results, use day-old bread. Fresh bread may not give you the same crispy texture.",
    "Heirloom tomatoes give this salad a unique flavor and color, but you can use any tomatoes you have on hand.",
    "Dressing: Adjust the balsamic vinegar and olive oil measurements to suit your taste.",
    "This salad is best served fresh. If you want to prepare it ahead, add the dressing and basil just before serving to keep the leaves and breadcrumbs crunchy.",
