      - "Stuff the cavity with a few sprigs of fresh thyme (optional)."
      - "Tie the chicken legs together with kitchen twine (optional)."
  - title: "Flavor the Chicken"

  - title: "Roast the Chicken"
    actions:
      - "Place the chicken breast-side up in a roasting pan. You can add chopped vegetables (potatoes, carrots, onions) around the chicken for a complete roasted meal (optional)."
