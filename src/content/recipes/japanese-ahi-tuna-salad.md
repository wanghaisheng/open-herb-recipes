recipeNotes:
  [
    "Ensure your ahi tuna is of sashimi quality, especially since it will be medium-rare.",
    "The cooking time for ahi tuna can vary depending on thickness, so adjust accordingly. The goal is to create a slight sear while keeping the center pink.",
    "If you prefer your tuna more or less cooked, adjust the grilling time to your preference.",
    "You can add other Japanese-inspired ingredients like daikon, edamame, or wakame to the salad.",
