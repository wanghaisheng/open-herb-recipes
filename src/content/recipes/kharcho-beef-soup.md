steps:
        - title: "Make the Khmeli Suneli Spice Mix (Optional)"
          actions:
            - "In a mortar and pestle or spice grinder, combine 1 teaspoon each of dried coriander seeds, blue fenugreek seeds, and marigold petals. Grind to a powder. Alternatively, use 1 ½ teaspoons of pre-made khmeli suneli spice mix."

        - title: "Brown the Beef"
          actions:
           - "In a large pot or Dutch oven, heat 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil over medium-high heat. Season 1 pound of beef stew meat, cut into bite-sized pieces, with salt and pepper. Add the beef to the hot oil and brown on all sides, about 5-7 minutes."

        - title: "Sauté the Onions and Garlic"
          actions:
           - "Transfer the browned beef to a plate. Add 1 tablespoon of butter to the pot and melt it over medium heat. Add 1 chopped onion and cook until softened, about 3 minutes. Stir in 2 cloves of minced garlic and cook for an additional minute, until fragrant."

        - title: "Deglaze the Pan and Add Tomatoes"
          actions:
           - "Pour in 1 cup of beef broth or water, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pot. Add 1 (14.5 oz) can of diced tomatoes, undrained, and bring to a simmer."

          actions:
           - "Return the browned beef to the pot. Add the prepared khmeli suneli spice mix (or store-bought), 1 bay leaf, and a pinch of dried red pepper flakes (adjust to your spice preference). Simmer for 30 minutes, or until the beef is tender."

        - title: "Cook the Rice"
          actions:
           - "In a separate pot, bring 1 cup of water or beef broth to a boil. Add 1/2 cup of rinsed white rice and a pinch of salt. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 15 minutes, or until the rice is cooked through and fluffy."

        - title: "Thicken the Soup (Optional)"
          actions:
            - "In a small bowl, whisk together 1 tablespoon of tomato paste with a little bit of water to create a slurry. Gradually stir the slurry into the soup until it reaches your desired consistency. You can also add a teaspoon of cornstarch mixed with water for thickening."

          actions:
           - "Stir the cooked rice into the soup pot. Remove the bay leaf. Taste and adjust seasonings with salt, pepper, and additional red pepper flakes if desired."

recipeNotes:
  [
    "Khmeli suneli is a Georgian spice blend that typically includes coriander, fenugreek, marigold petals, blue fenugreek, cloves, cinnamon, and sometimes chilies. If unavailable, you can substitute with a mixture of ground coriander, turmeric, and paprika.",
    "For a richer flavored soup, use bone-in beef chuck roast instead of stew meat. However, increase the cooking time until the beef is very tender, falling off the bone.",
    "Adjust the amount of red pepper flakes to your desired spice level. You can also add a chopped fresh chili pepper for an extra kick.",
    "Chopped fresh tarragon can be used in place of, or in addition to, cilantro and parsley for a different flavor profile."
