recipeNotes:
  [
    "Meatballs: If the lamb mixture is too sticky to form meatballs, you can add more breadcrumbs. If it's too dry, add a little more egg. For extra flavor, consider adding feta cheese to the meatball mixture.",
    "For crispier potatoes, make sure not to crowd the skillet while cooking them.",
    "Yogurt Sauce: If you're not a fan of mint, you can switch it out for dill or parsley.",
    "Leftovers can be stored in the refrigerator in an airtight container for up to 3 days. Reheat in the oven or microwave before serving.",
