steps:
  - title: "Prepare and Mix Ingredients"
    actions:
      - "Preheat your oven to 325°F (165°C). Grease and flour a loaf pan (8x4 inches) or a bundt pan."
      - "In a large mixing bowl, cream together softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy, about 3-5 minutes. Beat in eggs, one at a time, until fully incorporated after each addition. Scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed."
      - "In a separate bowl, whisk together all-purpose flour, baking powder, and a pinch of salt."
      - "Alternately add the dry ingredients and almond extract to the wet ingredients in three batches, mixing on low speed until just combined. Do not overmix. Fold in sliced almonds."

  - title: "Bake the Cake"
    actions:
      - "Pour the batter into the prepared pan."
      - "Bake for 60-75 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. If using a bundt pan, it may take closer to 75 minutes."

  - title: "Cool and Serve"
    actions:
      - "Let the cake cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely."
      - "Dust with powdered sugar for an optional finishing touch."
