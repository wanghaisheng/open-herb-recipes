recipeNotes: [
  "Quinoa Preparation: Rinse quinoa under cold water to remove its natural coating, saponin, which can make it taste bitter or soapy.",
  "Herbs: The herbs in this dish are key, so use the freshest parsley and mint you can find. Feel free to adjust the ratio of parsley to mint to your liking. Traditional tabbouleh has a higher ratio of parsley.",
