recipeNotes: [
  "Lentils: Green lentils hold their shape well and have a slightly firmer texture than red or yellow lentils. If you can't find green, you can use brown lentils instead.",
  "Be sure to rinse your quinoa under cold water before cooking to remove its natural coating, which can make it taste bitter.",
  "For added flavor, consider marinating the salmon in your favorite sauce or spices before cooking.",
  "Store leftovers in a sealed container in the fridge for up to 2 days. Reheat before serving."
