  "Feel free to get creative with your fillings—add different meats, seafood, or vegetables as per your preference.",
  "Dumpling Wrappers: These can usually be found in the freezer aisle of any Asian grocery store. Make sure to leave them out at room temperature for a bit before trying to separate them.",
  "Freezing: You can make these in bulk and freeze them. Just place them in a single layer on a baking sheet and freeze until solid before transferring them to a bag or container. You can cook them straight from the freezer, adding a few extra minutes to the cooking time.",
