recipeNotes: [
  "Chicken: If you prefer, you can use chicken thigh meat instead of breast. It's juicier and has more flavor.",
  "Deep Frying Tip: Don't overcrowd the pan when you're frying the chicken, it will lower the temperature of the oil and your chicken won't get as crispy.",
  "Sauce: If you prefer a smoother sauce, you can blend the sauce ingredients until smooth before cooking."
